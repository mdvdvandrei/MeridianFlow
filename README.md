# MeridianFlow: Understanding Oceanic Circulation Patterns and Sensitivity
This repository contains research and analysis on the study of meridional transport through latitude 60, focusing on understanding the dynamics and patterns of oceanic circulation. It includes code and resources related to the analysis of the NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) model's sensitivity in simulating meridional transport through this latitude.# MeridianFlow
